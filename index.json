Rinjani, Lombok, Indonesia   Video - Four days of hiking @ Mount Rinjani, Lombok, Indonesia.   Important Points:  The trek is hard and very exhausting. Book a deluxe package or private tour for a comfort and setting own pace. Warm clothes/mittens are a must during the nights. Sunscreen/Balaclava - There were few who were badly sunburnt. Pack as light as possible. (We were also carrying tripods and DSLRs). A good rain jacket to cover till feet. Our socks got wet in the rain and in turn the water seeped into the shoes from inside even though the boots we were using were waterproof. Pack Bandages for blisters. Book for a longer package to enjoy the trek than just hurrying to the next point. Off-season is the best time to visit. In the deluxe package, the porters bring along chairs for the hikers. We rarely used these chairs. It would have been better if there was another tent so that we had space to sleep properly.

The turning point was a short trip to Bintan from Singapore in August 2016. One of my friend (Vinod) had registered for IronMan event there and asked me to tag along his other companion had to drop out due to an emergency. Being the most unfit person on the whole island on those two days struck a chord with my conscience. Back to Singapore, I started serious preparations for the half marathon.\nCouple of weeks before the half marathon, Vinod suggested for going for a hike somewhere nearby and we started looking for destinations. Mt. Rinjani was chosen as the destination based on the reviews we found online and we started contacting the trek operators in Lombok to negotiate the details of the hike. The final itinerary was, I will be completing the half marathon on 4th December 2016 and start the hike to Mt. Rinjani on 7th December 2016\u0026hellip;\nA short review of my half-marathon experience  Being a honest participant, I had registered in the last batch to flag off as I knew that I will be slower than the other runners. This turned out to be a big disadvantage as when the last batch of runners reached the water stations, we were told that there is no more water. The event was so badly organized, we runners had to cross the barriers to go and buy water from the convenient stores along the way. I managed to complete my first half marathon in 3 hours 20 minutes despite.\n  Seinfeld has a perfect quote to describe a marathon: Ah, what\u0026rsquo;s to see? A woman from Norway, a guy from Kenya and 20,000 losers.\n The planning Hiking poles, Water bladder to carry in the backpack, hiking t-shirts and shorts, thermal wear, etc were all bought from Decathlon.\nSince the hike is on volcanic scree, we also picked up new shoes from Merrell.\nTour operators we contacted  Green Rinjani Lun Expeditions Rudy Trekker Trekking Rinjani Hajar Trekking, etc  We decided to go with Lun Expeditions as the price offered to us very competitive than the other operators and the reviews for the operator were also good.\nDecember is usually off-season as the trek is officially closed from January to March during the monsoons. The volcano had erupted in September 2016 and when we checked with the contact email on the official website, this was the reply we got:\n Its officially CLOSED as written on the website and we still don’t know when it will be open as from Metreology and Geofisika still warning us of the activity of the baby volcano.\n  Follow up Letter Head of Geological Agency of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources No. 2622/45 / BGLV / 2016 dated 27 September 2016 regarding Increased Activity Level Mount Rinjani from Level I (Normal) to Level II (Vigilant), then starting from Tuesday September 27, 2016 at 15:00 pm , the entire hiking trail to Mount Rinjani is closed from all climbing activities.\n The trek operators were still conducting the treks and the there were few recent reviews on TripAdvisor as well in November 2016. We decided to go through the trek even though the official site maintained by the Govt. was last updated in September for the volcano\u0026rsquo;s eruption.\nDeluxe package for 2 persons with Lun Expeditions was booked through Whatsapp. The price negotiated for the deluxe package was comparable to the standard package being offered by other operators and it was the best deal. Lun has been the most accommodating person we have come across in our travels. He arranged for our accommodation at Sembalun (Pesona Rinjani) instead of Senaru (as was the norm with all other operators we contacted) as we arrived late in the night at Lombok and were starting the trek the next morning.\nDay 1: 6th December 2016 We started from Singapore at 14:50 and reached Lombok at 23:00 hours.

This tourist trap is simply not worth the 200 baht you have to pay as tourists unless maybe you are a geology student.

Tourists are charged 200 Baht per person for entry and get to go down 20 more steps than the non-paying tourists. Since we were there early in the morning and the place was not yet open, we just took few photographs and left.\n  Fossil Beach     Long exposure with a 10 Stop ND Filter   We had thai style breakfast (rice, chicken and soup) at a local shop which seemed to be popular with the locals and the drove over to Ao Nang Beach to check the area in daylight.\n  The most popular mode of local transport in Thailand\u0026hellip;       It was low tide and we were not at all impressed!

This lake is approximately 2,000 metres (6,600 ft) above sea level and estimated to be about 200 metres (660 ft) deep; the caldera also contains hot springs. Sasak tribe and Hindu people assume the lake and the mount are sacred and some religious activities are occasionally done in the two areas.

The cloud cover on the caldera lake made sure we could not capture good shots of the lake from the summit.\n  This is on the other side of the summit which does not have a lake.

The descent took 3 hours 45 mins (5.21 KMs) and the last 1 hour was in heavy rain which added to the beauty of the landscape around Mt. Rinjani. We spent some time in the hot springs after lunch and began the steep climb to the Senaru crater rim. The ascend is just 4.11 KMs but takes 3.5 hours. The night on the Senaru crater was very peaceful with not much wind.

For the instance, choose Linux/Unix and select blueprint for OS Only. Under this category, choose Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.\n  Choose the instance plan for the lowest priced option at $3.50 USD per month.\n  No additional scripts are required at this time. Once you have selected the name for your instance, click on \u0026ldquo;Create Instance\u0026rdquo; button.\nThere are few additional steps required for accessing the instance and the documentation by AWS Lightsail covers the steps in detail. Please follow the link below to setup SSH, Assign a static IP, etc.\nhttps://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/docs/en_us/all\nUpdate Packages Update the installed packages with the following lines.\n# Update package lists sudo apt-get update  # Update installed packages sudo apt-get upgrade  UFW Ubuntu comes with it\u0026rsquo;s own firewall - UFW , but we will not be enabling this in our case as AWS Lightsail already comes with a firewall which you can configure under the networking tab in your instance. If the HTTPS port is not already available, use the \u0026ldquo;Add another\u0026rdquo; option to add the port 443 for HTTPS.\n  Once you have assigned the Static IP to your instance, modify the DNS Records at the domain registrar to point to the static IP.\n An A record with www.mydomain.com pointing to your server\u0026rsquo;s public IP address. An A record with mydomain.com pointing to your server\u0026rsquo;s public IP address.  Install Docker This example uses the script at get.docker.com to install the latest release of Docker CE on Linux.\ncurl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh  If you would like to use Docker as a non-root user, you should now consider adding your user to the “docker” group with something like: (replace your-user with ubuntu)\nsudo usermod -aG docker your-user   Remember to log out and back in for this to take effect!   Install NGINX  nginx [engine x] is an HTTP and reverse proxy server, a mail proxy server, and a generic TCP/UDP proxy server, originally written by Igor Sysoev. For a long time, it has been running on many heavily loaded Russian sites including Yandex, Mail.Ru, VK, and Rambler. According to Netcraft, nginx served or proxied 26.22% busiest sites in April 2019.\n Installing NGINX requires only the below command.\n# Install NGINX sudo apt-get install nginx  Once the installation is completed, you should be able to see the default NGINX html page when you access the static ip assigned to the Lightsail Instance through a browser.\n  Setup NGINX Server block This step is required so that it\u0026rsquo;s easier if you want to add/host multiple domains in the same instance. Initially, we will setup the domain name to point to a temporary server block so that the next step for Let\u0026rsquo;s encrypt can generate the required certificates for the domain.\n “VirtualHost” is an Apache term. NGINX does not have Virtual hosts, it has “Server Blocks” that use the server_name and listen directives to bind to tcp sockets. You can find some examples for server blocks at the NGINX wiki page.\n We will use the default directory /var/www/html for our initial setup. When you access the url http://mydomain.com, the Welcome to NGINX page should be displayed.\nCreate a copy of the default configuration into a new file.\nsudo cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-available/mydomain.com  Now, open the new file you created in your text editor with sudo privileges:\nsudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/mydomain.com  Copy the below lines in the editor and save:\nlisten 80; listen [::]:80; root /var/www/html; index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html; server_name mydomain.com www.mydomain.com; location / { try_files $uri $uri/ =404; } }  Enable the server block: Now that we have our server block files, we need to enable them. We can do this by creating symbolic links from these files to the sites-enabled directory, which Nginx reads from during startup.\nsudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/mydomain.com /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/  Follow the steps below to prevent hash bucket memory problem:\nsudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf  Within the file, find the server_names_hash_bucket_size directive. Remove the # symbol to uncomment the line:\nhttp { server_names_hash_bucket_size 64; }   Next, test to make sure that there are no syntax errors in any of your Nginx files:\n sudo nginx -t  If no problems were found, restart Nginx to enable your changes:\nsudo systemctl restart nginx   If you access the URL http://mydomain.com or http://www.mydomain.com, you should be able to see the NGINX start page now.   Install SSL certificates with Let\u0026rsquo;s encrypt Digital Ocean has an excellent guide for the installation of Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt certificates at this link. However, I will still provide the steps relevant to our current setup based on this guide below.\nInstall Let\u0026rsquo;s Encrypt certbot:\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot  You\u0026rsquo;ll need to press ENTER to accept.\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot   Certbot is now ready to use.   Obtain the SSL Certificate: Certbot provides a variety of ways to obtain SSL certificates through plugins. The Nginx plugin will take care of reconfiguring Nginx and reloading the config whenever necessary. To use this plugin, type the following:\nsudo certbot --nginx -d mydomain.com -d www.mydomain.com   Follow the instructions in the window and complete the setup.   Verify Auto Renewal\nsudo certbot renew --dry-run  NGINX Configuration to use SSL Now, open file you created in your text editor with sudo privileges:\nsudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/mydomain.com  Copy paste the below lines in the file.\nserver { listen 80; listen [::]:80; root /var/www/html; index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html; server_name mydomain.com www.mydomain.com; location / { try_files $uri $uri/ =404; } } server { listen 443 ssl; listen [::]:443 ssl; server_name mydomain.com www.mydomain.com; location / { proxy_pass\thttp://127.0.0.1:2368; proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr; proxy_set_header Host $http_host; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https; proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for; } ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/mydomain.com/fullchain.pem; # managed by Certbot ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/mydomain.com/privkey.pem; # managed by Certbot include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem; # managed by Certbot }  Running Ghost on Docker We will now use a docker file to pull the docker container and install in our Lightsail instance. You may use any path you are comfortable with. I have used the home directory of the default ubuntu user in the example below.\nThe below script assumes that you also want to configure Mailgun with your Ghost blog for triggering emails from the blog.\n The most important piece of configuration once you\u0026rsquo;ve been through the install process is to setup mail. Mail configuration allows Ghost to send emails such as lost password and user invite emails.\n  Follow instruction in the Mailgun setup to get the details for user and password for your account.   sudo nano /home/ubuntu/ghost.sh  Copy paste the below code in the file. You will have to check the current version of Ghost on Docker Hub and updated the version number to the latest version. As we are on the lowest configuration of Lightsail instance, it is recommended to use the alpine version of the docker image.\n#!/bin/sh docker rm -f ghost docker run --name ghost \\ -p 127.0.0.1:2368:2368 \\ -e url=https://www.mydomain.com \\ -v /etc/nginx/mydomain/html:/var/lib/ghost/content \\ -e mail__transport=\u0026quot;SMTP\u0026quot; \\ -e mail__from=\u0026quot;Admin \u0026lt;admin@mydomain.com\u0026gt;\u0026quot; \\ -e mail__options__service=\u0026quot;Mailgun\u0026quot; \\ -e mail__options__port=\u0026quot;587\u0026quot; \\ -e mail__options__host=\u0026quot;smtp.eu.mailgun.org\u0026quot; \\ -e mail__options__auth__user=\u0026quot;postmaster@mail.mydomain.com\u0026quot; \\ -e mail__options__auth__pass=\u0026quot;\u0026lt;use key from mailgun\u0026gt;\u0026quot; \\ --restart=always \\ -d ghost:2.22.0-alpine  Ghost Docker Hub Link\n Anytime there is a new version of the docker image, just update the script file and run again to update your ghost docker image to the latest version.   Once the script has completed running, you should be able to access the Ghost blog using the URL https://mydomain.com\nAdd /admin to the URL for the initial setup to setup the Ghost admin account.\n As we have configured the email with Mailgun in our script file, you can click on send button in the Test email configuration under \u0026ldquo;Labs\u0026rdquo; to verify your mailgun settings are working.\n ","date":1558396800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558396800,"objectID":"8f5d50c39ec1adb5a7b11f6f21be0923","permalink":"/blog/ghost-on-aws-lightsail/","publishdate":"2019-05-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/ghost-on-aws-lightsail/","section":"blog","summary":"Ghost is a free and open source blogging platform written in JavaScript and distributed under the MIT License, designed to simplify the process of online publishing for individual bloggers as well as online publications.","tags":["Blog","Tech"],"title":"Ghost (blog) on AWS Lightsail with Nginx, Let's Encrypt \u0026 Mailgun","type":"blog"},{"authors":["Nazim"],"categories":["Blog"],"content":" Amazon\u0026rsquo;s lightsail is a low cost VPS (Virtual Private Servers) with plans starting as low as $3.50 USD per month.\n A virtual private server (VPS) is a virtual machine sold as a service by an Internet hosting service.

Also known as The City of Nizams and The City of Pearls.\n Michel Joachim Marie Raymond’s Tomb 20-year-old Michel Raymond left France in 1775 for the Indian shores to become a merchant like his father, but Fate had other plans for him. He joined the French forces in Pondicherry in fighting the British. Their on-and-off skirmishes and Raymond’s role in the French victories brought him into the notice of the Nizam of Hyderabad. He joined the Nizam’s forces in 1786; a step that was to establish and cement his bonds with Hyderabad and its people, and become a part of its lore.\nHe rose in the ranks rapidly and became a trusted aide of the Nizam, to the extent that a “Gora” was given the crucial position of Amin Jinsi or Comptroller of Ordinance. Once he assumed charge, he revolutionized the artillery of the army and established the Gun foundry, which still stands today as a testimony to his vision. Under his guidance, the Nizam’s army became one of the best fortified and most formidable in the entire region.\nBattle was in his blood, but there was more to this man than just the art of war. Raymond was known far and wide as a good, kind man who never looked down upon the local populace unlike many other foreigners. His bravery, contribution to Hyderabad and his loyalty to the Nizam won him many epithets - to the Muslims he was Musa Rahim, and to the Hindus he was Musa Ram (whence the name Musarambagh).\nIt’s no surprise that when this foreigner died in 1798 at the young age of 43, he was deeply mourned by all. His dear friend the Nizam had a special memorial errected for him on the top of a hillock, and it still stands there today.\n The tomb is a black granite obelisk, and it has the initials JR on it. At the foot of the tomb lies a Grecian-styled pavilion, which is said to house the graves of his family. At the bottom of the hill lies another obelisk which was built over the remains of Raymond’s faithful dog and horse. Even in his death, the people of Hyderabad saw to it that he was surrounded by those he loved and who had loved him back.\n The years have not been kind to Raymond’s memories, with a handful of people knowing the location of the tomb and the stature of the man interred therein. The dilapidated tomb was rebuilt in April 2003, and an open-air theater around the Grecian pavilion was also constructed. And the tomb is still used as a venue for qawwali evenings held in his memory every year. But what you find when you go there today is weeds, graffiti and a sense of desolation.\nThe monogrammed tomb has a thin trickle of visitors, even after the renovation. The few people who do find their way there usually spend more time gazing into the panoramic view of Hyderabad that the hill affords. A cursory glance at the tomb and a few sniff of disdain about the disarray is what Raymond has been reduced to.\nThe story of Michel Raymond stands to become lost to the people of today unless it is retold. Here lies a man who was a saint of sorts to the locals. A lesser known one albeit, but a well-loved one nonetheless. He stands testimony to Hyderabad’s multihued culture, and to the friendliness of the locals who took a stranger from a far-off land into their hearts.\nSource: fullhyd.com\n How to get there: Going from Malakpet, at the Asmangarh Signals, where the left goes to Amberpet - take a right and go into the lane next to Hotel Sham. The road is steep and climbs crazily, go all the way up and come down the other side. At the bottom of the hill take a left and proceed some 400 mts. Finally you will find a faded grey board pointing to a lane - the Mons Raymond Monument is at the end of that lane lined with houses.    None of the Locals at Moosarambagh area knew about the existence of this tomb! This is the only board which we found. (We got the location after speaking to a policeman at the Malakpet station)     This one picture is sufficient to prove the state of maintenance here!   At the end of this passage, there are encroachments/huts and people are living inside the walls of a Protected monument!
